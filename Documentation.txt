Myself Pranay G Bendre. This project was told to made by ItVedant as a final project.
I started making a travel website but then changed my idea to make a Toy Store website.
I got this idea from my son as he likes the toys and we usually shop online.
Then I started taking references. My first reference was Hamleys and Winmagic website 
and then ideas just started coming to my mind and I started building up.
My biggest problem is I'm unable to validate the form layout properly. 
It is working but the layout is not right.
I hope you like my project.
Thank You.
